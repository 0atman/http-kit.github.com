title: Unified Async/Websocket API

<h2>Unified Async/Websocket API</h2>

<p>Using the latest and greatest:</p>
{% highlight clojure %}
[http-kit "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT"] ; Add to your project.clj

(:use org.httpkit.server) ; import namespace
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="note">
  The API is fully working, but is still working in progress.
  If interested, use <a href="https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/issues">GitHub issues page</a> for suggestions, bug reports, or general discussions.
  Please refer <a href="https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/blob/protocol-api/src/org/httpkit/server.clj">server.clj</a> more detail, it has pretty clear docstr.
</p>

<p class="note">
  This API is not compatabile with `2.0.0-rc4`.
</p>

<h3 id="motivation" class="anchor">Motivation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support HTTP streaming</li>
  <li>Unify the API for HTTP (streaming or long-polling) and WebSockets: easy degradate to long-polling/streaming when WebSocket is not available in client</li>
  <li>Sever also get notified when client close/away for long-polling/streaming</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="protocol" class="anchor">Channel Protocol</h3>

<p>Unified asynchronous channel interface for HTTP (streaming or long-polling) and WebSockets.</p>

Channel defines the following contract:
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>open?</code>: Returns true iff channel is open.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>close</code>: Closes the channel. Idempotent: returns true if the channel was actually closed, or false if it was already closed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>websocket?</code>: Returns true iff channel is a WebSocket.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>send!</code>:
    Sends data to client and returns true if the data was successfully sent,
    or false if the channel is closed. Data is sent directly to the client,
    NO RING MIDDLEWARE IS APPLIED.

    Data form: {:headers _ :status _ :body _} or just body. Note that :headers
    and :status will be stripped for WebSockets and for HTTP streaming responses
    after the first.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>on-receive</code>:
    Sets handler (fn [message-string]) for notification of client WebSocket
    messages. Message ordering is guaranteed by server.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>on-close</code>:
    Sets handler (fn [status]) for notification of channel being closed by the
    server or client. Handler will be invoked at most once. Useful for clean-up
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="get-channel" class="anchor">Get the channel</h3>

<p>A macro <code>with-channel</code> is provided, example: </p>

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn handler [req]
  (with-channel req channel ;; get the channel,
    ;; channel can be HTTP(long-polling, streaming) or Websocket
    ;; manipulate them with a unified API
    ))
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="polling" class="anchor">Long polling exmaple</h3>

<p>long polling is very much like streaming</p>

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn handler [request]
  (with-channel request channel
    (on-some-event ;; wait for event
     (send! channel {:status 200
                     :headers {"Content-Type" "application/json; charset=utf-8"}
                     :body "polling resulg"}
            true))))                    ; send! and close

(run-server handler {:port 9090})
{% endhighlight %}


<h3 id="streaming" class="anchor">Streaming example</h3>
{% highlight clojure %}
(defn handler [request]
  (with-channel request channel
    (loop [id 0]
      (when (< id 10)
        (schedule-task (* id 200) ;; sent a message every 200ms
                       (send! channel (str "message from server #" id)))
        (recur (inc id))))
    (schedule-task 10000
                   ;; close in 10s
                   (close channel))))

;;; open you browser http://127.0.0.1:9090, a new message show up every 200ms
(run-server handler {:port 9090})
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="websocket" class="anchor">Websocket excample</h3>

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn handler [request]
  (with-channel request channel
    (on-receive channel (fn [data]
                          ;; echo it back
                          (send! channel data)))))

(run-server handler {:port 9090})
